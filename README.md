### Peer-graded Assignment: Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto

In this assignment, I have explored, segmented, and clustered the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. Feel free to explore the notebook by adding your Fourtsquare credentials you can perform the same analysis (CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET).

You can found the analysis also in html-form in the repository.

**Task 1: Creating the preliminary dataframe and printing the number of rows**

I wrangled the Toronto neighborhood data, cleaned it, read it into a pandas dataframe, and finally presented it in a structured form like the New York dataset.

The link to the source data can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M).

The dataframe is presented in the end of the chapter 1.

**Task 2: Adding latitudes and longitudes of neighbourhoods in the dataframe**

In order to utilize the Foursquare location data, I added the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.
The new dataframe is presented in the end of the chapter 2.

**Task 3: The replication of the analysis with Toronto data set**

I replicated the analysis similar to the New York City dataset. I explored and clustered the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. The work was separated in the following subchapters:

+ Restricting the analysis into neighbourhoods with name 'Toronto'
+ Presenting the map of Toronto
+ The Foursquare part - locate venues around neigbourhoods
+ Explore neighborhoods in Toronto
+ Analyzing each neighborhood by neighborhood
+ Clustering the neighborhoods
+ Examining clusters and giving them names

I formed 6 clusters and gave them names describing the areas:
- Cluster 1 - Coffee Shops and Delicates (Red label)
- Cluster 2 - Bermunada Triangle (Purple label)
- Cluster 3 - Locks and Latches (Petrol Blue label)
- Cluster 4 - Boutiques (Darker Green label)
- Cluster 5 - Parks (Light Green label)
- Cluster 6 - Health and Beauty (Orange label)

The colour label is presented in the map. The clusters you can find in the end of the document.
