# Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1)

### 1. Introduction - Business Problem Description

In this assignment, 

In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?

_A description of the problem and a discussion of the background_

_Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem._

_This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it._

### 2. Data



_A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem_

_Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data._

_This submission will eventually become your Data section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Data section) to your Github repository and submit a link to it._

I have explored, segmented, and clustered the neighborhoods in the city of Lyon. Feel free to explore the notebook by adding your Fourtsquare credentials you can perform the same analysis (CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET).

You can found the analysis also in html-form in the repository.

## 3. Data extracton, processing and reporting plan and tasks

**Task 1: Creating the preliminary dataframe and printing the number of rows**

I wrangled the Lyon neighborhood data, cleaned it, read it into a pandas dataframe, and finally presented it in a structured form like the New York dataset.

The link to the source data can be found here: http://www.map-france.com/department-Rhone/.

The dataframe is presented in the end of the chapter 1.

**Task 2: Adding latitudes and longitudes of neighborhoods in the dataframe**

In order to utilize the Foursquare location data, I added the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.

The new dataframe is presented in the end of the chapter 2.

**Task 3: The replication of the analysis with Lyon data set**

I replicated the analysis similar to the New York City dataset. I explored and clustered the neighborhoods in the city of Lyon. The work was separated in the following subchapters:
+ Restricting the analysis into neighborhoods with name 'Lyon'
+ Presenting the map of Lyon
+ The Foursquare part - locate venues around neigbourhoods
+ Explore neighborhoods in Lyon
+ Analyzing each neighborhood by neighborhood
+ Clustering the neighborhoods
+ Examining clusters and giving them names

I formed 6 clusters and gave them names describing the areas:
+ Cluster 1 - Coffee Shops and Delicates (Red label)
+ Cluster 2 - Bermunada Triangle (Purple label)
+ Cluster 3 - Locks and Latches (Petrol Blue label)
+ Cluster 4 - Boutiques (Darker Green label)
+ Cluster 5 - Parks (Light Green label)
+ Cluster 6 - Health and Beauty (Orange label)

The colour label is presented in the map. The clusters you can find in the end of the document.
